## About me
I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** with **7+ years of experience** building **scalable, production-grade systems end-to-end**, specializing in backend engineering and cloud-native delivery.

I focus on building **reliable distributed systems**, designing maintainable architectures (**Clean Architecture, DDD, SOLID**), and delivering features with strong ownership — from system design to production.

✅ Strong backend expertise  
✅ End-to-end ownership (design → build → deploy → operate)  
✅ Event-driven systems and async processing  
✅ FinTech / SaaS / Enterprise experience  
✅ Cross-functional collaboration (product, frontend, infra)

---

## Core Stack
- **Backend:** TypeScript, Node.js, NestJS  
- **Data:** PostgreSQL, Prisma, Redis, MongoDB  
- **Cloud/DevOps:** AWS (ECS, RDS, S3, SQS), Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)  
- **Architecture:** Microservices, Event-Driven Architecture, Clean Architecture, DDD  
- **Other:** Python, Django, Next.js (integration level)

---

## What I’m looking for
I’m currently open to **global remote opportunities** as:
- Senior Backend Engineer
- Senior Software Engineer (Backend-Focused)
- Node.js / TypeScript Engineer

If your team builds **scalable, high-reliability systems**, I’d love to connect.

## How I work
- **Architecture-first mindset:** clear boundaries, scalability, maintainability
- **Reliability:** idempotency, retries, observability, clean deployments
- **Performance:** optimized queries, indexing, caching strategies
- **Ownership:** I care about production, monitoring, CI/CD and long-term evolution

---

## Quick highlights
- Modernized production systems (Python 2.7 → Django 4.x)
- Built event-driven pipelines (RabbitMQ, Redis, Celery, AWS SQS)
- Reduced deployment time by **60%** using Docker + AWS ECS/RDS
- Designed microservices and scalable APIs for FinTech workflows
